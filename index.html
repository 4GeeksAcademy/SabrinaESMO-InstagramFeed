                        I love <strong>bookstagram</strong> and I think this is a very good exercise 
                        for me to learn about building a feed like this. <br>
                        I'll share some of my actual "bookstagram" account photos because... why not?</p>

                        <p>As book lover, finding the work of <strong>Brandon Sanderson</strong> made 
                            me live a before and after. His stories are so original and well written, 
                            but what I like the most is the way he builds the magic laws on his worlds. 
                            Normally, the characters who get some kind of power are those who were 
                            broken at some point, depressed or damaged.</p>

                            <strong>Adrienne Young</strong> has built a world full of adventure, passion, 
                            intrigue, family issues, friendship and a touch of magic. Simply amazing.</p>

                        <p>In Catalunya, on April 23rd we celebrate <strong>Sant Jordi</strong> filling the streets with
                            roses and books. It is my favourite festivity, one that comes from a legend that 
                            involves a princess, a prince and a dragon. I really love how that day, the streets 
                            of my city (and all other around Catalonia) are full of people admiring and sharing 
                            their love for literature.</p>
